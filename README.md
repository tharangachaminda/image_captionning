# Image Captioning with CNN, NLP, RNN and LSTM

Image captioning in deep learning refers to the process of generating textual descriptions or captions for an image automatically using deep neural networks. This task involves combining computer vision techniques to understand the visual content of an image and natural language processing (NLP) to generate a coherent and relevant textual description.

Image captioning is a popular research area in deep learning world. It combines various Neural Network types such as **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)**, **Recurrent Neural Network (RNN)**, and RNN techniques such as **Long Short Term Memory (LSTM)** model.

## Project Goal
